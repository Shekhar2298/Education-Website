          <h3>What is Puberty?</h3>
          <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Puberty is the period of life when a person's body undergoes physical and hormonal changes, preparing them for reproductive maturity. It typically begins between ages 8-13 for girls and 9-14 for boys, though timing varies widely.</p>

        <p>Puberty involves more than just physical changes. Adolescents also experience significant emotional and social development:</p>

        <div class="resource-box">
          <h4>Menstrual Cycle Basics</h4>
          <p>The menstrual cycle typically lasts 21-35 days, with bleeding lasting 3-7 days. The cycle involves several phases:</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">Is it normal to start puberty earlier or later than friends?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes, the timing of puberty varies widely and is influenced by genetics, nutrition, and overall health. Starting earlier or later than peers is completely normal. However, if puberty begins before age 8 in girls or age 9 in boys, or hasn't started by age 13 in girls or 14 in boys, it's advisable to consult a healthcare provider.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">How can I manage acne during puberty?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Acne is common during puberty due to increased oil production. Effective management includes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Gentle cleansing twice daily with a mild cleanser</li>
              <li>Avoiding harsh scrubbing, which can irritate skin</li>
              <li>Using non-comedogenic (non-pore-clogging) products</li>
              <li>Not picking or squeezing pimples, which can cause scarring</li>
              <li>Consulting a dermatologist for persistent or severe acne</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">What if I'm uncomfortable with the changes happening to my body?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>It's normal to feel awkward or self-conscious about body changes during puberty. Remember that these changes are natural and happening to everyone around your age, even if at different rates. Talking to trusted adults, such as parents, school counselors, or healthcare providers, can help. Many schools also have peer support programs where you can discuss these changes with others experiencing similar feelings.</p>

      <!-- Consent Section -->
      <section id="consent" class="content-section">
        <h2>Understanding Consent and Healthy Boundaries</h2>
        <p>Consent is a fundamental aspect of all healthy relationships, especially sexual relationships. Understanding and practicing consent ensures that all interactions are respectful, safe, and mutually desired.</p>
        
        <div class="definition-box">
          <h3>What is Consent?</h3>
          <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Consent is the voluntary agreement of all individuals involved in any activity, especially sexual activity. It must be given freely, without pressure, coercion, or manipulation. Consent is specific, reversible, informed, enthusiastic, and ongoing (often remembered with the acronym FRIES).</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>The FRIES Model of Consent</h3>
        <p>This model helps clarify what constitutes valid consent:</p>
        
        <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr)); gap: 1rem;">
          <div class="resource-box">
            <h4>Freely Given</h4>
            <p>Consent is given without pressure, manipulation, or under the influence of drugs or alcohol. It should be a choice made freely.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="resource-box">
            <h4>Reversible</h4>
            <p>Anyone can change their mind at any time, even if they've previously said yes or are in the middle of sexual activity.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="resource-box">
            <h4>Informed</h4>
            <p>All parties must know what they're agreeing to. Being dishonest or withholding information invalidates consent.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="resource-box">
            <h4>Enthusiastic</h4>
            <p>Consent should be an excited "yes!" rather than reluctant agreement or absence of "no." Look for active participation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="resource-box">
            <h4>Specific</h4>
            <p>Consent to one activity doesn't mean consent to others. Each new activity requires its own clear agreement.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <h3>How to Ask for and Give Consent</h3>
        <p>Clear communication is essential for obtaining and giving consent. Here are practical examples:</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h4>Asking for Consent</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>"Are you comfortable with this?"</li>
            <li>"Would you like to...?"</li>
            <li>"Is it okay if I...?"</li>
            <li>"How are you feeling about this?"</li>
            <li>"What would you like to do?"</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
          <h4>Giving or Denying Consent</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>"Yes, I'd like that." (enthusiastic consent)</li>
            <li>"No, I'm not comfortable with that." (clear denial)</li>
            <li>"I'm not sure, let's slow down." (uncertainty)</li>
            <li>"I'd prefer to..." (alternative suggestion)</li>
            <li>"I need to stop." (withdrawing consent)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h3>What Does NOT Count as Consent?</h3>
        <p>It's crucial to understand situations that cannot constitute valid consent:</p>
        
        <div class="warning-box">
          <h4>Non-Consensual Situations</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Silence or passivity:</strong> Not saying "no" is not the same as saying "yes"</li>
            <li><strong>Previous consent:</strong> Agreeing to something once doesn't mean perpetual consent</li>
            <li><strong>Under the influence:</strong> Someone who is intoxicated cannot give meaningful consent</li>
            <li><strong>Coercion or pressure:</strong> Consent given due to threats or persistent pressure is invalid</li>
            <li><strong>Unconsciousness:</strong> Someone who is asleep or unconscious cannot consent</li>
            <li><strong>Assumed consent:</strong> Relationship status, clothing, or flirtation do not imply consent</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Setting and Respecting Boundaries</h3>
        <p>Boundaries are personal limits that help define what we're comfortable with in relationships. Healthy boundaries protect wellbeing and promote mutual respect.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">Can consent be non-verbal?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>While verbal consent is clearest, non-verbal cues can sometimes indicate consent through enthusiastic participation. However, non-verbal consent has limitations and can be misinterpreted. The safest approach is to seek verbal confirmation, especially in new relationships or when trying new activities. When in doubt, ask!</p>

          <div class="faq-question">What if someone changes their mind during sexual activity?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Consent can be withdrawn at any time. If someone says "stop," seems uncomfortable, or withdraws participation, you must stop immediately. Continuing after consent is withdrawn constitutes sexual assault. Check in with your partner regularly to ensure ongoing comfort and enthusiasm.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Age of consent laws vary by location but generally establish when a person can legally consent to sexual activity. These laws exist to protect young people from exploitation. In many places, the age of consent is 16-18. It's important to know the laws in your area and understand that sexual activity with minors may constitute statutory rape regardless of apparent consent.</p>

          <div class="faq-question">Can you get pregnant the first time you have sex?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes, pregnancy can occur during any vaginal intercourse, including the first time. Pregnancy happens when sperm fertilizes an egg, which is possible whenever sperm enters the vagina. The risk exists regardless of whether it's your first time or hundredth time having sex. Using reliable contraception is the best way to prevent unintended pregnancy.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>With perfect use, condoms are 98% effective at preventing pregnancy. With typical use (accounting for human error), they're about 82% effective. Condoms are highly effective at preventing many STIs, including HIV, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. For best protection:</p>
            <ul>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Emergency contraception (often called the "morning-after pill") can prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex. It should be used as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse, but different types have different timeframes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Levonorgestrel pills:</strong> Effective up to 72 hours (most effective within 24 hours)</li>

          <div class="faq-question">Is it normal to be curious about porn?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes, curiosity about sexuality, including porn, is normal, especially during adolescence when sexual development occurs. Many people explore pornography out of curiosity about bodies, sexuality, or sexual activities. The key is developing critical thinking skills to understand that porn depicts performance rather than realistic sexual relationships.</p>

          <div class="faq-question">Can porn consumption become problematic?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">

              <li><strong>Environmental impact:</strong> The carbon footprint of streaming and data storage</li>

        <h2>Relationships and Emotional Intimacy</h2>
        <p>Healthy relationships involve mutual respect, trust, communication, and boundaries. Understanding different types of relationships and how to navigate them promotes emotional wellbeing.</p>
        
        <h3>Distinguishing Love from Infatuation</h3>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">How do I know if I am in love or just infatuated?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Love is a deep emotional connection involving care, trust, respect, and commitment. Infatuation is intense, often short-lived attraction or idealization of someone.</p>
            <p><strong>Use:</strong> Distinguishing love from infatuation helps make responsible decisions in relationships, reducing emotional harm.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Differences:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Infatuation</strong> tends to be based on idealization and intense physical attraction, often fading quickly</li>
              <li><strong>Love</strong> develops over time, involves genuine care for the other person's wellbeing, and withstands challenges</li>
              <li><strong>Infatuation</strong> often focuses on how the other person makes you feel</li>
              <li><strong>Love</strong> involves concern for the other person's happiness and growth</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Observe patterns over time. Healthy communication, mutual support, and respect indicate lasting love rather than fleeting infatuation.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Masturbation and Self-Exploration</h3>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">Is masturbation normal and healthy?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Masturbation is the self-stimulation of the genitals for sexual pleasure. It is a natural part of human sexuality.</p>
            <p><strong>Use:</strong> Masturbation can help individuals explore their bodies, relieve stress, and understand their sexual preferences safely.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A teenager touching their own genitals for pleasure or stress relief is normal. It becomes unhealthy only if it disrupts daily life or school/work responsibilities.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Practice in private, maintain hygiene, and balance it with social and academic responsibilities.</p>
            <p>Masturbation is a normal, healthy sexual behavior that most people engage in at some point in their lives. It:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Helps people learn about their bodies and sexual responses</li>
              <li>Can relieve sexual tension and stress</li>
              <li>Does not cause physical or mental health problems</li>
              <li>Is safe (no risk of pregnancy or STIs)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Concerns about masturbation typically arise from cultural or religious beliefs rather than health considerations. If masturbation becomes compulsive or interferes with daily life, speaking with a counselor can help establish healthy boundaries.</p>

        <h3>LGBTQ+ Topics and Inclusivity</h3>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">Is it okay to be attracted to the same sex or more than one gender?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Sexual orientation is a person's pattern of emotional, romantic, or sexual attraction. It may be toward the same sex, multiple genders, or different sexes.</p>
            <p><strong>Use:</strong> Understanding sexual orientation fosters acceptance, mental well-being, and supportive communities.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A person may realize they are attracted to someone of the same sex (homosexual) or more than one gender (bisexual/pansexual).</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Accept your feelings, seek safe support groups, and communicate openly with trusted friends or counselors if needed.</p>
            <p>Sexual orientation exists on a spectrum and includes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Heterosexual:</strong> Attraction to a different gender</li>
              <li><strong>Homosexual:</strong> Attraction to the same gender</li>
              <li><strong>Bisexual:</strong> Attraction to more than one gender</li>
              <li><strong>Pansexual:</strong> Attraction regardless of gender</li>
              <li><strong>Asexual:</strong> Little or no sexual attraction</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All sexual orientations are normal and valid. What matters most in relationships is that they are consensual, respectful, and bring happiness to those involved.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <div class="faq-question">What is the difference between sex and gender?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Sex refers to biological attributes like anatomy and chromosomes. Gender refers to social roles, identity, and expression, which may not align with biological sex.</p>
            <p><strong>Use:</strong> Knowing the difference promotes inclusion, reduces stereotypes, and helps respect personal identity.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> A person assigned male at birth may identify as female (transgender), or someone may identify outside male/female categories (non-binary).</p>
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Respect people's chosen pronouns and identity, and educate yourself about gender diversity.</p>
            <p>Key distinctions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Sex:</strong> Typically assigned at birth based on physical characteristics; includes male, female, and intersex</li>
              <li><strong>Gender Identity:</strong> A person's internal sense of their own gender; may be man, woman, both, neither, or another gender</li>
              <li><strong>Gender Expression:</strong> How a person presents their gender through appearance, behavior, and mannerisms</li>
              <li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Who a person is attracted to; separate from gender identity</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Understanding these distinctions helps create more inclusive environments where all people feel respected.</p>
