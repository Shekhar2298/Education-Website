                    <h2>Why Relationships & Consent Matter</h2>
                    <p>Relationships shape our health, happiness and safety. Whether between friends, family members, partners, classmates or colleagues, the quality of our interactions determines emotional wellbeing, productivity and social trust. Consent and clear communication are the foundations: they prevent harm, reduce confusion, and enable mutual respect.</p>
                    <p>In India and around the world, conversations about consent, boundaries and digital safety are becoming essential because the internet, social media and changing social norms have created new opportunities and new risks. This guide gives you practical language, scripts, checklists, and examples you can use today.</p>

                    <h2>Understanding Consent</h2>
                    <p>Consent means agreeing to something with a clear, informed, and voluntary "yes." It is a practice—something you ask for and something you listen for. Consent is required for physical intimacy, sharing private information or images, and for many everyday interactions (borrowing possessions, taking photos, close physical contact).</p>

                    <h3>The FRIES Model of Consent</h3>
                    <p>The FRIES model is a helpful mnemonic that outlines the essential characteristics of consent:</p>
                    
                    <div class="resource-list">
                        <div class="resource-item">
                            <h4>Freely Given</h4>
                            <p>Consent must be given without pressure, manipulation, or coercion. It should be a choice made without fear of consequences for saying no.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="resource-item">
                            <h4>Reversible</h4>
                            <p>Anyone can change their mind at any time, even if they've previously consented. Consent is not a one-time permission that applies indefinitely.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="resource-item">
                            <h4>Informed</h4>
                            <p>All parties must know what they're agreeing to. Withholding information or lying invalidates consent.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="resource-item">
                            <h4>Enthusiastic</h4>
                            <p>Consent should be an excited "yes!" rather than reluctant agreement. Look for active participation, not just absence of "no."</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="resource-item">
                            <h4>Specific</h4>
                            <p>Consent to one activity doesn't mean consent to others. Each new activity requires its own clear agreement.</p>
                        </div>

                        <h4>In Indian Context:</h4>
                        <p>Traditional values emphasizing family harmony and respect for elders can sometimes make explicit consent conversations challenging. However, these conversations are increasingly important in modern India where individual autonomy is valued alongside family relationships. Finding culturally appropriate ways to discuss boundaries and consent is essential.</p>

                    <p>Regardless of cultural background, everyone has the right to bodily autonomy and to set boundaries in their relationships. Learning to navigate consent respectfully within cultural contexts is a skill that strengthens rather than undermines cultural values.</p>

                    <h3>Repair Language</h3>
                    <p>Repairing after a conflict matters. Useful phrases include:</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>A: The legal age of consent for sexual activity in India is 18 years. This means that individuals below 18 cannot legally consent to sexual activity, and sexual contact with minors may be considered statutory rape regardless of consent. Laws vary and age-of-consent and related statutes are specific. For legal advice about age or statutory questions, consult a qualified legal professional. If you are under distress or danger, seek immediate support from local authorities or helplines.</p>

                            <p>A: Yes — many clinics and NGOs offer confidential counseling and testing to adolescents. In India, the Adolescent Friendly Health Clinics (AFHCs) under the Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK) program provide confidential services. Ask for "confidential" or "adolescent-friendly" services when you call or visit. Healthcare providers are trained to respect your privacy while providing appropriate care.</p>

                            <p>A: Listen without judgment, believe their experience, help them make a safety plan, and connect them to professional help. Don't pressure them to take specific actions; support their choices and safety. Useful phrases include: "I believe you," "This wasn't your fault," and "How can I support you right now?" Encourage them to contact helplines or support services, but respect their pace in seeking help.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>A: Curiosity about sexuality, including porn, is normal, especially during adolescence when sexual development occurs. Use non-judgmental conversations to explain that porn is entertainment and not a realistic guide to relationships or consent. Recommend trusted educational resources instead. If porn consumption becomes compulsive or interferes with daily life, it may be helpful to speak with a counselor or trusted adult.</p>

                            <p>A: You have the right to decide when and if you want to be in a relationship. If you're feeling pressured, clearly state your boundaries: "I'm not ready for a relationship right now," or "I prefer to just be friends." If the pressure continues, limit contact with that person and seek support from trusted friends or adults. Remember that healthy relationships involve mutual interest, not pressure or coercion.</p>

                            <p>A: Signs of an unhealthy relationship include: feeling afraid, controlled, constantly criticized, isolated from friends and family, pressured into sexual activity, or having your boundaries repeatedly disrespected. Trust your instincts—if something consistently feels wrong in your relationship, it likely is. Speak with a trusted adult or counselor who can help you assess your situation objectively.</p>

                            <p>A: Questioning your gender identity or sexual orientation is a normal part of self-discovery for many people. There's no rush to define yourself—exploration is okay. Seek out accurate information from reliable sources and consider connecting with LGBTQ+ support organizations that can provide resources and community. Speaking with a counselor who has experience with gender and sexuality can also be helpful.</p>
