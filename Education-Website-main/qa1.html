  <main>
    <h2>What is consent?</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Consent is the voluntary agreement of all individuals involved in any activity, especially sexual activity. It must be given freely, without pressure, coercion, or manipulation.</p>
    <p><strong>Use:</strong> Understanding consent ensures that all parties feel respected and safe. It is essential in healthy relationships and legal compliance.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If someone says “no” or seems hesitant, consent is not given. Even a “yes” can be withdrawn at any time. Clear verbal or unambiguous non-verbal consent is necessary.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Always ask, communicate openly, and respect boundaries. If unsure, pause and clarify consent before proceeding.</p>

    <h2>How do I know if I am in love or just infatuated?</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Love is a deep emotional connection involving care, trust, respect, and commitment. Infatuation is intense, often short-lived attraction or idealization of someone.</p>
    <p><strong>Use:</strong> Distinguishing love from infatuation helps make responsible decisions in relationships, reducing emotional harm.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Feeling excited about someone may be infatuation. Caring about their well-being, sharing values, and supporting each other indicates love.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Observe patterns over time. Healthy communication, mutual support, and respect indicate lasting love rather than fleeting infatuation.</p>

    <h2>What changes happen during puberty?</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Puberty is the period of life when a person’s body undergoes physical and hormonal changes, preparing them for reproductive maturity.</p>
    <p><strong>Use:</strong> Awareness helps adolescents understand normal growth and emotional changes, reducing anxiety and confusion.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Physical changes include growth spurts, breast development in girls, voice deepening in boys, and hair growth. Emotional changes include mood swings and increased interest in relationships.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Accept the changes as normal, maintain hygiene, and seek trusted guidance from parents, teachers, or healthcare providers.</p>

    <h2>Is masturbation normal and healthy?</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Masturbation is the self-stimulation of the genitals for sexual pleasure. It is a natural part of human sexuality.</p>
    <p><strong>Use:</strong> Masturbation can help individuals explore their bodies, relieve stress, and understand their sexual preferences safely.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A teenager touching their own genitals for pleasure or stress relief is normal. It becomes unhealthy only if it disrupts daily life or school/work responsibilities.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Practice in private, maintain hygiene, and balance it with social and academic responsibilities.</p>

    <h2>Can you get pregnant the first time you have sex?</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Pregnancy occurs when sperm fertilizes an egg, which can happen even during the first sexual encounter.</p>
    <p><strong>Use:</strong> Understanding the risk helps in making informed decisions about sexual activity and contraception.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A couple who has unprotected sex may risk pregnancy the very first time.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use reliable contraception (condoms, pills, IUDs) and emergency contraception if needed. Seek professional guidance for safe sexual practices.</p>

    <h2>What contraceptive options exist?</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Contraception refers to methods used to prevent pregnancy and, in some cases, reduce STI risks.</p>
    <p><strong>Use:</strong> Selecting the right method prevents unintended pregnancy and promotes reproductive health.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Common options include condoms (barrier method), oral contraceptives (hormonal pills), injectables, implants, IUDs, and emergency contraception.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Consult a healthcare provider to choose the method that fits your needs, lifestyle, and health considerations.</p>

    <h2>How effective are condoms?</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Condoms are thin barrier devices worn over the penis or inside the vagina to prevent pregnancy and STI transmission.</p>
    <p><strong>Use:</strong> They are one of the most accessible and effective methods for preventing pregnancy and many sexually transmitted infections.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Correctly using a condom every time during sex significantly reduces the risk of HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and pregnancy.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Follow instructions carefully, check expiration dates, use water-based lubricants, and never reuse condoms.</p>

    <h2>What are STIs and how are they prevented?</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are infections spread through sexual contact, including vaginal, anal, or oral sex.</p>
    <p><strong>Use:</strong> Awareness and prevention of STIs protects health, fertility, and reduces complications.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> STIs include chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV, syphilis, and HPV.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use condoms consistently, get vaccinated (e.g., HPV vaccine), get regular testing, and maintain open communication with partners.</p>

    <h2>Is it okay to be attracted to the same sex or more than one gender?</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Sexual orientation is a person’s pattern of emotional, romantic, or sexual attraction. It may be toward the same sex, multiple genders, or different sexes.</p>
    <p><strong>Use:</strong> Understanding sexual orientation fosters acceptance, mental well-being, and supportive communities.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A person may realize they are attracted to someone of the same sex (homosexual) or more than one gender (bisexual/pansexual).</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Accept your feelings, seek safe support groups, and communicate openly with trusted friends or counselors if needed.</p>

    <h2>What is the difference between sex and gender?</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Sex refers to biological attributes like anatomy and chromosomes. Gender refers to social roles, identity, and expression, which may not align with biological sex.</p>
    <p><strong>Use:</strong> Knowing the difference promotes inclusion, reduces stereotypes, and helps respect personal identity.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A person assigned male at birth may identify as female (transgender), or someone may identify outside male/female categories (non-binary).</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Respect people’s chosen pronouns and identity, and educate yourself about gender diversity.</p>

    <h2>Is porn a reliable source of sex education?</h2>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Pornography (including porn, xxx, xvideo) is sexually explicit material intended for entertainment, not education.</p>
    <p><strong>Use:</strong> Relying on porn for sexual education can create unrealistic expectations, promote unsafe behaviors, and misunderstand consent.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Porn rarely shows condom use, consent negotiation, or emotional aspects of sex.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use evidence-based resources like health organizations, educators, and counselors to learn about sex, boundaries, and healthy relationships.</p>
