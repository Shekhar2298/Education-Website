        <p style="max-width:800px; margin:1rem auto; font-size:1.2rem; color:#444;">
            A strong foundation in sex education begins with understanding human sexuality, anatomy, and puberty.
            This chapter helps you develop body confidence, emotional awareness, and respect — essential for healthy
            relationships and lifelong well-being.

        <section id="introduction" style="margin-bottom:3rem;">
            <h2 style="font-size:2rem; color:#1a1a7f;">1.1 Introduction to Human Sexuality</h2>
            <p>
                Human sexuality is a natural and integral part of life. It refers not only to physical attraction or
                sexual activity
                but also to emotions, identity, values, and how we express ourselves as human beings.
                Understanding sexuality helps individuals respect their own bodies and those of others.
            </p>
            <p>
                Comprehensive sex education teaches that sexuality includes four key dimensions:
            </p>
            <ul style="margin-left:2rem;">
                <li><strong>Physical:</strong> The biological and reproductive aspects of the human body.</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional:</strong> Feelings of affection, attraction, and love that connect people.</li>
                <li><strong>Social:</strong> How cultural norms and relationships shape our understanding of sex and
                    gender.</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical:</strong> Personal values and consent — understanding right, respect, and
                    responsibility.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                When we learn about sexuality through trusted sources, we replace myths with facts and confusion with
                confidence.
                The goal is not to encourage sexual activity but to provide accurate knowledge so individuals can make
                informed, safe, and responsible decisions.
            </p>

        <section id="anatomy" style="margin-bottom:3rem;">
            <h2 style="font-size:2rem; color:#1a1a7f;">1.2 Anatomy and Reproductive Systems</h2>
            <p>
                Our bodies are incredible and deserve understanding and respect. Knowing about anatomy helps us take
                care of our health and avoid misinformation.
                The reproductive system is part of the human body that allows for reproduction and growth.
                While male and female systems are different, both play important roles in reproduction and hormonal
                balance.
            </p>

            <h3>Male Reproductive System</h3>
            <p>
                The male reproductive system includes organs such as the <strong>penis</strong>,
                <strong>testes</strong>, <strong>scrotum</strong>,
                and <strong>prostate gland</strong>. These organs work together to produce and deliver sperm.
                Testosterone, the primary male hormone, supports growth, muscle development, and sexual function.
            </p>

            <h3>Female Reproductive System</h3>
            <p>
                The female reproductive system includes the <strong>vagina</strong>, <strong>uterus</strong>,
                <strong>fallopian tubes</strong>, and <strong>ovaries</strong>.
                These organs support menstruation, fertilization, and pregnancy. The hormone estrogen regulates
                reproductive cycles and other body functions.
            </p>

            <h3>Why Learning Anatomy Matters</h3>
            <ul style="margin-left:2rem;">
                <li>Promotes body confidence and positive self-image.</li>
                <li>Prevents myths and misinformation about sex and reproduction.</li>
                <li>Encourages healthy hygiene and body care.</li>
                <li>Helps identify signs of illness early and seek medical help when needed.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Understanding your body is empowering — it builds confidence and respect for your own physical and
                emotional health.

        <!-- Chapter 1.3 -->
        <section id="puberty" style="margin-bottom:3rem;">
            <h2 style="font-size:2rem; color:#1a1a7f;">1.3 Puberty and Body Changes</h2>
            <p>
                Puberty is a stage when a child’s body develops into an adult body capable of reproduction.
                It is driven by hormones — chemicals produced by glands that control body growth and changes.
            </p>

            <h3>Physical Changes</h3>
            <p>
                During puberty, both boys and girls experience physical growth like height increase, voice changes, and
                hair growth.
                Girls begin menstruation (periods), while boys experience sperm production.
                These changes are completely normal and happen at different ages for everyone — usually between 9 and 16
                years old.
            </p>

            <h3>Emotional Changes</h3>
            <p>
                Hormonal shifts can also bring mood swings, curiosity, and strong emotions.
                It’s normal to feel confused or sensitive during this phase. Talking to trusted adults or educators
                helps you understand and manage these feelings.
            </p>

            <h3>Hygiene & Self-Care</h3>
            <p>
                As bodies change, personal hygiene becomes even more important:
            </p>
            <ul style="margin-left:2rem;">
                <li>Bath regularly and wear clean clothes to prevent infections.</li>
                <li>Use deodorant if needed to control body odor.</li>
                <li>Keep genitals clean and dry.</li>
                <li>Girls should change sanitary pads regularly during menstruation.</li>
                <li>Maintain a balanced diet and exercise for hormonal balance and good health.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Embracing Change</h3>
            <p>
                Puberty is not something to be afraid of — it’s a natural part of becoming who you are.
                Everyone grows at their own pace, and no two bodies are the same.
                Self-acceptance and open communication help build a positive and confident mindset.
            </p>

  <h2 style="font-size:2.2rem; color:#1a1a7f;">Module 2: Building Healthy Relationships</h2>
  <p style="font-size:1.1rem; color:#444;">
    Relationships are at the heart of human life — with friends, family, or partners. 
    Building healthy connections requires respect, empathy, boundaries, and good communication. 
    This chapter focuses on understanding consent, emotional intelligence, and mutual trust.
  </p>

  <!-- Section 2.1 -->
  <section id="understanding-relationships" style="margin-top:2rem;">
    <h3 style="font-size:1.6rem; color:#222;">2.1 Understanding Relationships</h3>
    <p>
      A healthy relationship is one where both people feel safe, respected, and valued. 
      It’s based on honesty, equality, and care — not control or fear. 
      Relationships can be romantic or platonic, but the same principles of kindness, understanding, and trust apply to all.
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-left:2rem;">
      <li>Respect each other’s individuality and opinions.</li>
      <li>Communicate openly and listen without judgment.</li>
      <li>Encourage personal growth and independence.</li>
      <li>Manage disagreements peacefully — no shouting or pressure.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Remember: it’s okay to have differences. True maturity lies in handling them respectfully, not forcing others to change.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 2.2 -->
  <section id="consent" style="margin-top:2rem;">
    <h3 style="font-size:1.6rem; color:#222;">2.2 Consent: The Foundation of Trust</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Consent</strong> means agreeing freely and willingly to something — especially in physical or emotional interactions. 
      It’s never assumed, pressured, or taken for granted. 
      Consent must be clear, enthusiastic, and can be withdrawn at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Understanding consent protects everyone’s boundaries and dignity. 
      Whether it’s sharing feelings, hugging, or physical intimacy — always ask first.
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-left:2rem;">
      <li>“No” means <strong>no</strong> — always.</li>
      <li>Silence or hesitation is <strong>not consent</strong>.</li>
      <li>Consent can change — respect that immediately.</li>
      <li>Being under alcohol, drugs, or pressure means <strong>consent is invalid</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Practicing consent shows empathy and emotional maturity. 
      It builds relationships based on safety and genuine trust — not fear or obligation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 2.3 -->
  <section id="communication" style="margin-top:2rem;">
    <h3 style="font-size:1.6rem; color:#222;">2.3 Communication and Emotional Connection</h3>
    <p>
      Communication is the bridge that connects hearts and minds. 
      In healthy relationships, people talk about their feelings openly and listen with care. 
      Misunderstandings are resolved calmly, not through blame or silence.
    </p>
    <h4>Tips for Better Communication</h4>
    <ul style="margin-left:2rem;">
      <li>Use “I feel…” statements instead of blame — it encourages openness.</li>
      <li>Listen fully before responding — not just waiting to speak.</li>
      <li>Be honest, but also gentle with words.</li>
      <li>Apologize when wrong — it strengthens, not weakens, a bond.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Good communication helps both people grow emotionally and fosters trust — 
      making relationships not just lasting, but deeply fulfilling.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 2.4 -->
  <section id="boundaries" style="margin-top:2rem;">
    <h3 style="font-size:1.6rem; color:#222;">2.4 Setting and Respecting Boundaries</h3>
    <p>
      Boundaries define what makes you feel comfortable or uncomfortable in any relationship. 
      Setting boundaries isn’t selfish — it’s healthy and necessary. 
      Respecting others’ boundaries is equally important.
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-left:2rem;">
      <li>Decide what personal space, communication, or topics feel safe for you.</li>
      <li>Express your limits calmly and clearly — no guilt or fear.</li>
      <li>Respect others’ right to say “no” or take time for themselves.</li>
      <li>Never cross emotional or physical limits without permission.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Boundaries protect emotional well-being and help build mutual respect — 
      turning relationships into supportive, safe, and balanced experiences.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 2.5 -->
  <section id="red-flags" style="margin-top:2rem;">
    <h3 style="font-size:1.6rem; color:#222;">2.5 Recognizing Unhealthy Relationships</h3>
    <p>
      Not all relationships are positive. 
      Unhealthy or toxic relationships often involve manipulation, control, or emotional harm. 
      Learning to recognize warning signs helps you protect yourself and seek help early.
    </p>
    <ul style="margin-left:2rem;">
      <li>Jealousy used as a sign of “love” or control.</li>
      <li>Constant criticism or guilt-tripping.</li>
      <li>Pressure for sex, money, or secrets.</li>
      <li>Isolation from family and friends.</li>
      <li>Emotional, verbal, or physical abuse.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you ever feel unsafe, talk to a trusted adult, counselor, or contact a helpline. 
      You deserve respect, safety, and peace in every relationship.
